Users should wait for setup to finish when running s-talk before sending messages (cat or otherwise).

When running with Valgrind, the only memory leaks are the "still reachable" leaks, which can be ignored as stated by 
the professor on Piazza.

When sending a cat file with no '!', s-talk detects EOF and exits sender as suggested by the professor on Piazza.
S-talk still allows for messages to be received and will exit either manually or if the other user sends a '!'.
Also when the receiving terminal sends a '!' back, it exits both terminals however the terminal sending the file will end
with and error possibly due to it cancelling threads that have already exited. This was undefined behaviour so I handled
it accordingly.

When an error message about cancelling appears, it is most likely due to a thread already having been exited
and is trying to be cancelled.

Sometimes a terminal when receiving a large file (~4000 characters), it only receives half or so, possibly due to packets 
lost through UDP, but can still send and receive. It can then be exited by receiving a '!' or sending a '!'.# S-Talk
